# Roadmap
This program will be written in Java, though it's planned to create a Kotlin version later on.
The project is seperated in four versions:

## V0.1
- basic functionality
    + copies to backup folder
    + opens KeePass with most recent file from backup folder
    + catches exceptions
- only hardcoded settings

## V0.2
- Exception handling
- do some refactoring to make program more modular
- write tests

## V1.0
- no hardcoded settings
    + can be set in an external settings file

## V1.0K
- create a Kotlin version
